So you want to help build the Optimism Collective? We are so excited to have you! 

There are 3 main ways you can contribute:

1. [Join a Contribution Path](./start-contributing.md) and start contributing now! 
    - User support through the [NERDs Program](./nerd-req.md).
    - Community marketing through the [Ambassadors Program](./ambassador-req.md).
1. [General developer contributions](./dev-contributions.md). A lot of code is needed to make a blockchain run, you can help make it better! 
1. Wildcard contributions. If you see something missing, or think you can make something better, do it! You don't have to go through a super structured path or ideas list to know what needs to get done.
