## Translation Skills & Rules

üöÄ You should believe in the optimistic values: Open, transparent, in support of public goods (if you have not heard about our [RetroPGF, go check it out!](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c)).

- Make sure that you are in [Optimism Discord](https://discord.gg/optimism).

### Pre-flight checklist

- You should be familiar with Optimism well before you start your translations. The below user docs link can help you understand Optimism better. If you have any questions during your translation, you can always ask in the Discord server.

- Local translators should gain translation skills. We encourage community members to join translator program, but you should be good at both English and your local languages. You can check the current 21 languages list in [#üìñÔ∏±resources-for-everyone](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/961585633334263839/961594291258527764) .
- Auto Google translations are forbidden.  Why?
Google translations are low quality, inaccurate, and often mistranslate crypto specific terminology. Users can access these auto translations easily, and as such we DO NOT want these auto translations as our official translations.
- The translation articles should have good quality. For the translation articles will be shared in Optimism local language community, misleading or auto google translation will lead you excluded of the translator program.
- All community translation articles will be shown and shared in [#üìñÔ∏±resources-for-everyone channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/961585633334263839/961594291258527764) . Check your local language articles list in your local language thread in the channel, better translate the articles that have not been translated yet.
- Translation review is suggested and always welcome to post to #translators channel in Optimism discord server.

## Original articles resources

- Currently ONLY official Optimism articles can be included in translator program which are only listed in the below resources:

[OptimismFND Twitter](https://twitter.com/OptimismFND)

[The Optimism Collective Mirror](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/)

[Optimism Medium](https://optimismpbc.medium.com/)

[The Optimistic Dev Blog](https://dev.optimism.io/)

[Users docs](https://help.optimism.io/) which you can help translate through the [Crowdin platform](https://crowdin.com/profile/Optimism). **This is the best way to help contribute!**

## Publishing platforms

- You should make your own platform accounts name suitable and **NO "official" words are allowed to use in the names.**. An example name is "Optimism Spanish Community Translation". 
- Translation articles should include **the original article links**.
- Google docs, Notion and other private collaboration tools will not be considered as a contribution as they are not fully accessible to public.

## Apply the translation links to OP discord

Once you published translation, go to Optimism discord and post your translations link in #translators channel.

Please use the below format:
```
Translation article Link:

Translation article title:

Translation language:  
```

Check in [#üìñÔ∏±resources-for-everyone](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/961585633334263839/961594291258527764) if your local language isn not there it can be added, otherwise your article will be added to the existing thread.
