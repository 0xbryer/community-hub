A contribution path creates a structured path for anyone to gain context and trust in a reliable and scalable manner. Paths allow for new members to immediately contribute at their skill level and contextual understanding, as well as providing a clear path to increasing their contextual understanding and skill (through mentorship). 

The core purpose of Contribution Paths is to enable _anyone_ who is interested to be able to gain the required context to contribute. 

## The Process

Contribution Paths all follow the same high level structure. This structure enables anyone to be able to build up context around a specific contribution opportunity. 

The structure follows a few key steps. These steps are signals of intent and understanding around the topic. This topic could be anything! User & developer support, marketing, protocol contributions. This framework can accommodate it all! Where `x` is the specific topic. 

`wannabe-x` → `x-in-training` → `x` → `super-x`

At each of these steps the contributor will need to prove understanding as well as ability. Do they have the required context and skill to contribute at the next level?
