title: The OP Stack Client SDK
lang: en-US
---

There are a few areas in which the SDK can help you navigate [the differences between OP Mainnet and Ethereum](../developers/build/differences/):

- [Gas costs](../developers/build/transaction-fees.md)
- [Interlayer communication](../developers/bridge/basics.md)

The SDK supports multiple OP Chains: OP, Base, etc.
To see whether a specific OP Chain is supported directly, [see the documentation](https://sdk.optimism.io/enums/l2chainid).
Chains that aren't officially supported just take a few extra steps.
Get the L1 contract addresses, and [provide them to the SDK](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/sdk/#contract-addresses).
Once you do that, you can use the SDK normally.
