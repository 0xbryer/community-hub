title: Running a node without Docker
lang: en-US

Here are the instructions if you want to build you own read-only replica without relying on our images. These instructions were generated on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS box, but they should work with other systems too.

Note: This is not the recommended configuration. While we did QA on these instructions and they work, the QA that the docker images undergo is much more extensive.

# Prerequisites

## Hardware requirements

Replicas need to store the transaction history of OP Mainnet (or the relevant OP testnet) and to run Geth. They need to be relatively powerful machines (real or virtual). We recommend at least 16 GB RAM, and an SSD drive with at least 500 GB free (for OP Mainnet).

## Software requirements

Youâ€™ll need the following software installed to follow this tutorial:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- [Go](https://go.dev/)

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation)

- [Make](https://linux.die.net/man/1/make)

- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)

- [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

- [zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/)

### Build the Optimism Monorepo

Create an empty directory (this tutorial will label it: `optimism-no-docker`) in a path of your choice.

Using a terminal in `optimism-no-docker`:
1. Clone the [Optimism Monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
    ```

2. Install required modules. 
   This is a slow process, while it is running you can already start building `op-geth`, as shown below.

    ```bash
    cd optimism
    pnpm install
    ```

3. While still in `optimism-no-docker/optimism`, build the various packages inside of the Optimism Monorepo.

    ```bash
    make op-node
    pnpm build
    ```

### Build op-geth

Using a terminal in `optimism-no-docker`:

1. Clone [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth.git
    ```


1. Build `op-geth`:

    ```bash
    cd op-geth    
    make geth
    ```

The rest of the steps depend on whether you are building on OP mainnet or a testnet.
