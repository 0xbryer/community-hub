::: info Migrated vs Non-Migrated Networks
Migrated Networks, *OP Mainnet* and *OP Goerli*, were running before the Bedrock upgrade. Non-Migrated Networks, *OP Sepolia*, have only existed in a post Bedrock world. The way transaction execution is handled is funadmentally different pre- vs post-bedrock. Migrated networks are required to initialize their nodes with a data directory and non-migrated networks can simply initialize from a genesis file.
:::

## OP Goerli initialization

### Get the data directory

The next step is to download the data directory for `op-geth`.

1. Download the data directory snapshot. This is a large file so expect it to take some time. [Bedrock Data Directory (5.0GB)](https://datadirs.optimism.io/goerli-bedrock.tar.zst)

::: tip Protip
Use a tool like [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) to reduce the chance of your data directory being corrupted.
:::

2. Check the validity of your download. This is an important step. Corrupted data directories will make your node fail. So ensure your checksum matches.
   
   ```sh
   sha256sum goerli-bedrock.tar.zst
   # expected output
   1b2d3022e378ad1dcf1fb5abbb9ebcd3826db5d34fb53d0f1d0f8448648a5a6b  goerli-bedrock.tar.zst
   ```

   OR
   
   ```sh
   sha512sum goerli-bedrock.tar.zst
   # expected output
   7d420ddf34ee5b157d60cf7a9612cb950b24ff1405e1ab944f8d7910c45e7a46907bdb86ea124a8069b15ad9e171776ab5f8ed0146c43b0ff12539f38f262f7d  goerli-bedrock.tar.zst
   ```

3. Create the data directory in `op-geth` and fill it. This will take time.
   
   Using a terminal in `op-geth`, run these commands:
   ```sh
   mkdir datadir
   cd datadir
   tar xvf <<PATH_TO_DATA>>
   ```

#### (Optional - Archive Node) Get the data directory for `l2geth`

1. Download the data directory snapshot. This is a large file so expect it to take some time. [Legacy Geth Data Directory (2.9TB)](https://datadirs.optimism.io/mainnet-legacy-archival.tar.zst)

::: tip Protip
Use a tool like [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) to reduce the chance of your data directory being corrupted.
:::

2. Check the validity of your download. This is an important step. Corrupted data directories will make your node fail. So ensure your checksum matches.

   ```sh
   sha256sum mainnet-legacy-archival.tar.zst
   # expected output
   4e6eccc4a5dff7eda1fc27d440496b48f3baab05add55daa0cb7b3558af21f59  goerli-legacy-archival.tar.zst
   ```

   OR
   
   ```sh
   sha512sum mainnet-legacy-archival.tar.zst
   # expected output
   5d78c1f2cd5bea062fb979b9d616a5fe4c55b27a444812b91a90340631d7a5f750c4e6e5a352513f3cf102d61586a4e2861f1aa3827e5be8fcae01e2ec291d2a  goerli-legacy-archival.tar.zst
   ```

3. Create the data directory in `l2geth` and fill it. This will take time.

   Navigate into your `l2geth` directory and run these commands:
   ```sh
   mkdir datadir
   cd datadir
   tar xvf <<PATH_TO_DATA_DIR>>
   ```

## OP Sepolia initialization

OP Sepolia is non-migrated network so it requires initialization via genesis file. `op-geth` uses JSON files to encode a network's genesis information. You'll need to download the genesis JSON, then run the following command to initialize the data directory:

```bash
curl -o <path to genesis JSON> -sL <URL to genesis JSON>

geth init \
	 --datadir="<your data directory>" \
	 "<path to genesis JSON>"
```

### Create a shared secret between `op-geth` and `op-node`

1. Navigate into your `op-geth` directory and run these commands:

   ```sh
   openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
   cp jwt.txt ../optimism/op-node
   ```

### Scripts to start the different components

In the root of your working directory create a new directory: `scripts`.

### (Optional - Archive Node) `l2geth`

1. Navigate into your `scripts` directory:

2. Create a new file: 
   ```sh
   touch run-l2geth.sh
   ```

3. Make it executable: 
   ```sh
   chmod +x run-l2geth.sh
   ```

4. Insert this snippet of code into `run-l2geth.sh` and modify the path to the `l2geth` directory.

   ```sh
   #!/usr/bin/bash

   cd ../optimism-legacy/l2geth

   USING_OVM=true \
     ETH1_SYNC_SERVICE_ENABLE=false \
     RPC_API=eth,rollup,net,web3,debug \
     RPC_ENABLE=true \
     RPC_PORT=8546 \ # need to rebind port because op-geth uses the same default port
     ./build/bin/geth --datadir ./datadir --goerli
   ```

5. Run the following command to start `l2geth`:
   
   ```sh
   ./run-l2geth.sh
   ```

### `op-geth`


2. Create a new file: 
   ```sh
   touch run-op-geth.sh
   ```

3. Make it executable: 
   ```sh
   chmod +x run-op-geth.sh
   ```

4. Insert this snippet of code into `run-op-geth.sh` and modify the path to the `op-geth` directory.

    ```sh
    #! /usr/bin/bash

    SEQUENCER_URL=https://mainnet-sequencer.optimism.io/

    cd <<Path to op-geth directory>>

    ./build/bin/geth \
      --datadir=./datadir \
      --http \
      --http.port=8545 \
      --http.addr=0.0.0.0 \
      --authrpc.addr=localhost \
      --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
      --verbosity=3 \
      --rollup.sequencerhttp=$SEQUENCER_URL \
      --nodiscover \
      --syncmode=full \
      --maxpeers=0 \
      --snapshot=false
    ```

::: info Archive Nodes
You will need to point `op-geth` at `l2geth` with `--rollup.historicalrpc`: Enables the historical RPC endpoint. This endpoint is used to fetch historical execution data from Legacy Geth. This flag is only necessary for upgraded networks.

You will also need to add `--gcmode archive`.
:::

::: info Snapshots
For the initial synchronization it's a good idea to disable snapshots (`--snapshot=false`) to speed it up. 
Later, for regular usage, you can remove that option to improve geth database integrity.
:::

Other Sequencer URLs can be found here: [Networks, Public RPC Endpoints, & APIs](../../useful-tools/networks.md).

5. Run the following command to start `op-geth`:
   
   ```bash
   ./run-op-geth.sh
   ```

### `op-node`

1. Navigate to the `scripts` directory you created.
   
2. Create a new file: 
   ```sh
   touch run-op-node.sh
   ```
3. Make it executable: 
   ```sh
   chmod +x run-op-node.sh
   ```
4. Insert this snippet of code into `run-op-node.sh`:
   
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/bash

    L1URL=<< URL to L1 >>
    L1KIND=basic
    NET=<< goerli OR sepolia >>

    cd <<Path to op-node directory>>


    ./bin/op-node \
        --l1=$L1URL  \
        --l1.rpckind=$L1KIND \
        --l2=http://localhost:8551 \
        --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
        --network=$NET \
        --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
        --rpc.port=8547

    ```     


- Change `<< URL to L1 >>` to a service provider's URL for the L1 network (L1 Goerli or Sepolia).
- Set `L1KIND` to the network provider you are using (options: alchemy, quicknode, infura, parity, nethermind, debug_geth, erigon, basic, any).

5. Run the following command to start `op-node`:
   
    ```bash
    ./run-op-node.sh
    ```

### The initial synchronization

The datadir provided by Optimism is not updated continuously, so before you can use the node you need a to synchronize it.

During that process you get log messages from `op-node`, and nothing else appears to happen.

```
INFO [06-26|13:31:20.389] Advancing bq origin                      origin=17171d..1bc69b:8300332 originBehind=false
```

That is normal - it means that `op-node` is looking for a location in the batch queue. 
After a few minutes it finds it, and then it can start synchronizing.

While it is synchronizing, you can expect log messages such as these from `op-node`:

```
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.460] Sync progress                            reason="processed safe block derived from L1" l2_finalized=ef93e6..e0f367:4067805 l2_safe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_unsafe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_time=1,673,564,096 l1_derived=6079cd..be4231:8301091

```

And log messages such as these from `op-geth`:

```
INFO [06-26|14:02:12.974] Imported new potential chain segment     number=4,068,194 hash=a334a0..609a83 blocks=1         txs=1         mgas=0.000  elapsed=1.482ms     mgasps=0.000   age=5mo2w20h dirty=2.31MiB

INFO [06-26|14:02:12.982] Starting work on payload                 id=0x5542117d680dbd4e
```

#### How long will the synchronization take?

To estimate how long the synchronization will take, you need to first find out how many blocks you synchronize in a minute. 

You can use this script, which uses [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). 

Using a terminal in `optimism-no-docker/scripts`:
   1. create a new file: `touch run-estimate.sh`.
   2. Make it executable: `chmod +x run-estimate.sh`.
   3. Copy and Paste this snippet of code into `run-estimate.sh`.
```sh
#! /usr/bin/bash

export ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
CHAIN_ID=`cast chain-id`
echo Chain ID: $CHAIN_ID
echo Please wait

if [ $CHAIN_ID -eq 10 ]; then
  L2_URL=https://mainnet.optimism.io
fi


if [ $CHAIN_ID -eq 420 ]; then
  L2_URL=https://goerli.optimism.io
fi

if [ $CHAIN_ID -eq 11155111 ]; then
  L2_URL=https://sepolia.optimism.io
fi

T0=`cast block-number` ; sleep 60 ; T1=`cast block-number`
PER_MIN=`expr $T1 - $T0`
echo Blocks per minute: $PER_MIN


if [ $PER_MIN -eq 0 ]; then
    echo Not synching
    exit;
fi

# During that minute the head of the chain progressed by thirty blocks
PROGRESS_PER_MIN=`expr $PER_MIN - 30`
echo Progress per minute: $PROGRESS_PER_MIN


# How many more blocks do we need?
HEAD=`cast block-number --rpc-url $L2_URL`
BEHIND=`expr $HEAD - $T1`
MINUTES=`expr $BEHIND / $PROGRESS_PER_MIN`
HOURS=`expr $MINUTES / 60`
echo Hours until sync completed: $HOURS

if [ $HOURS -gt 24 ] ; then
   DAYS=`expr $HOURS / 24`
   echo Days until sync complete: $DAYS
fi
```
4. run the command `./run-estimate.sh`  


### Operations

It is best to start `op-geth` first and shut it down last.
