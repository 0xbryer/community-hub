## Governance Fund Grant Proposals

You can apply for grant funding from the Governance Fund by submitting an [Application](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-applicant-guide-how-to-submit-a-mission-application/6899) to a Mission Request which will be evaluated by theÂ Optimism Grants Council or Foundation.

## Non-Grant Proposal Types

There are [other types of proposals](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types) that you can submit.

There is no minimum holding requirement for submitting a proposal but all non-grant proposals must be approved by four delegates with sufficient voting power to move to a vote (as defined in [the operating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types)).

The process for submitting non-grant proposals is outlined in the [the operating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types)
